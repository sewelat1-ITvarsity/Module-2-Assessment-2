                    <h3>PICK N PAY</h3>
                    <p>Pick n Pay is the second largest supermarket chain store in South Africa, established in 1967. It can also be found in other regions of southern Africa, such as Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland, and had plans to open in Malawi but has yet to do so. The founder of the chain was Jack Goldin, a native of Obeliai, Lithuania who moved to South Africa when the Nazis invaded his town. Raymond Ackerman purchased three Pick n Pay supermarkets in Cape Town from Goldin, and served as executive chairman until his retirement in 2010. His eldest son, Gareth, is the current chairman.

Due to a slump in profits in July 2011 the company told labour unions that it would lay off 3,137 of its 36,673 staff.

As of 2018, the company was operating over 1,600 locations across 7 countries in Southern Africa. In that year's annual report, the company announced a planned expansion into Nigeria, and that it was considering expanding into Ghana. Pick n Pay also operates stores under the Boxer brand in South Africa and Swaziland.</p>
